# Director's Cut RPG Dice - Usage Examples

This module brings beautiful, high-quality dice faces to Foundry VTT that perfectly match the look and feel of the Discord bot. Each die appears as a square with rounded corners using actual image files from the Discord bot, providing pixel-perfect matching.

## Basic Rolling

### Roll Command
```
/roll 5
```
This will roll 5 dice and display them as styled dice faces. The results will show:
- **Roll:** with dice displayed as square image-based dice faces
- Success breakdowns (Basic, Critical, Extreme, etc.)
- Interactive buttons for rerolls

### Single D6 Roll
```
/d6
```
Rolls a single d6 using the Outgunned dice style.

### Coin Flip
```
/coin
```
Flips a coin (HEADS=bad, TAILS=good).

## Dice Appearance

The dice use high-quality WebP image files that exactly match the Discord bot:

### Outgunned Dice Faces
Each die uses the actual image files from the Discord bot, ensuring perfect visual consistency:
- **1:** White circle (‚óã)
- **2:** Red heart (‚ô•)
- **3:** Gold crown/crest
- **4:** Black spade-like symbol
- **5:** Red crossed swords/X pattern
- **6:** Gold star (‚òÖ)

These are the exact same image files used by the Discord bot's custom dice emojis.

## Interactive Rerolls

After rolling, you'll see buttons for available actions. The roll summary will show clean icons (üîÑ ‚ö° üéØ) to identify different phases:

### üîÑ Re-roll (Green Button)
- Available if you have unmatched dice and at least one success
- Rerolls unmatched dice
- If the result isn't better, you lose your lowest success

### ‚ö° Free Re-roll (Blue Button)
- Available if you have unmatched dice (no success requirement)
- Rerolls unmatched dice with no penalty
- Requires appropriate character feat

### üéØ All In (Red Button)
- Available after a successful reroll if you have unmatched dice
- If the result isn't better, you lose ALL previous successes

## Example Roll Sequence

```
/roll 6
```

**Result might look like:**
```
Roll: [‚ô•][‚ô•][‚òÖ][‚òÖ][‚òÖ][‚óã] üëç
üîÑ: [‚ô•][‚ô•][‚òÖ][‚òÖ][‚òÖ][‚ô•] üëç

1 Critical: [‚ô•][‚ô•][‚ô•]
1 Critical: [‚òÖ][‚òÖ][‚òÖ]
```

Then you could click **üéØ All In** to try for even better results with any remaining unmatched dice.

## Success Levels

The module recognizes different success levels based on the number of matching dice:

- **2 matches = Basic Success** (green text)
- **3 matches = Critical Success** (orange text) 
- **4 matches = Extreme Success** (red text)
- **5 matches = Impossible Success** (purple text)
- **6+ matches = Jackpot Success** (gold text with glow animation)
